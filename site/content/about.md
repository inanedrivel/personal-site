I like computers, open source software, LaTeX, licenses, mathematics, and just finding out what interesting things people make when they are bored or motivated enough.

For personal reasons, I try to avoid social media. If you would like to contact me for any reason, please use my [webmail](mailto:tim.duong@mail.utoronto.ca).
